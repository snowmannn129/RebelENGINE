# Camera System

The camera system is responsible for managing view perspectives, handling camera movements, and controlling how the game world is presented to the player.

## Core Components

   - Physical camera
   - Custom camera projections

2. **Camera Properties**
   - Field of view (FOV)
   - Near/far planes
   - Aspect ratio
   - Projection matrix
   - View matrix

3. **Camera Controls**
   - Position and rotation
   - Look-at targeting
   - Orbit controls
   - First-person controls
   - Third-person controls
