# Lighting System

The lighting system is a critical component that manages all aspects of illumination in a game engine, from real-time lighting to global illumination solutions.

## Core Components

1. **Light Types**
   - Directional lights (sun/moon)
   - Point lights
   - Spot lights
   - Area lights
   - Volumetric lights

2. **Shadow Systems**
   - Shadow mapping
   - Cascaded shadow maps (CSM)
   - Variance shadow mapping
   - Percentage closer filtering (PCF)
   - Percentage closer soft shadows (PCSS)

3. **Global Illumination**
   - Real-time global illumination (RTGI)
   - Light probes
   - Ambient occlusion
   - Lightmapping
   - Screen space global illumination (SSGI)

## Implementation Features

### Real-time Lighting
- Forward lighting
- Deferred lighting
- Clustered forward lighting
- Tile-based deferred lighting
- Light culling and management

### Shadow Techniques
- Dynamic shadow resolution
- Shadow atlas management
- Contact shadows

- Caustics
- Subsurface scattering
- Screen space reflections (SSR)

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - Light culling techniques
   - Shadow map pooling
   - Resolution scaling
   - LOD system for shadows
   - Dynamic quality settings

2. **Memory Management**
   - Light data structures
   - Shadow map allocation

   - Cache coherency
   - Resource streaming

3. **Quality vs Performance**
   - Scalable lighting features
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Quality presets
   - Dynamic feature adjustment

## Advanced Features

1. **Physical-Based Lighting**
   - Energy conservation
   - Physical light units
   - Color temperature
   - HDR lighting
   - Eye adaptation

2. **Dynamic Environments**
   - Time of day system
   - Weather effects
   - Dynamic sky lighting
   - Indoor/outdoor transitions
   - Light bounce simulation

3. **Special Effects**
   - Lens flares
   - Light shafts
   - Atmospheric scattering
   - Color grading integration
   - Bloom and glare

## Debug Tools
