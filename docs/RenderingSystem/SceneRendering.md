# Scene Rendering

Scene rendering is a fundamental component of a game engine's rendering system, responsible for efficiently drawing the game world to the screen.

## Key Components

1. **Render Pipeline**
   - Forward rendering
   - Deferred rendering
   - Hybrid rendering approaches

2. **Culling Systems**
   - Frustum culling
   - Occlusion culling
   - Portal culling
   - Level of Detail (LOD) management

3. **Draw Call Management**
   - Batching techniques
   - Instancing
   - Draw call optimization

4. **Render Queue**
   - Sorting objects by material/shader
   - Transparency handling
   - Z-depth management

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- View frustum culling
- Efficient scene graph traversal
- Dynamic batching of similar objects
- GPU instancing for repeated elements

### Quality Settings
- Scalable quality levels
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Resolution scaling

### Modern Features
- Multiple render targets (MRT)
- Screen-space effects integration
- Dynamic resolution scaling

## Best Practices

1. **Scene Organization**
   - Efficient scene graph structure
   - Spatial partitioning
   - Object pooling for dynamic elements

2. **Memory Management**
   - Texture streaming
   - Mesh LOD systems
   - Resource caching

3. **Cross-Platform Considerations**
   - API abstraction
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Fallback rendering paths

## Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Identifying CPU/GPU bounds
   - Optimizing render state changes
   - Reducing overdraw

2. **Quality vs Performance**
   - Scalable rendering features
   - Dynamic quality adjustments
   - Platform-specific optimizations

3. **Debugging and Profiling**
   - Frame debugger integration
   - Performance markers
   - Visual debugging tools
