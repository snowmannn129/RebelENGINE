# RebelENGINE Weekly Progress Report

## Week of March 13, 2025 - March 19, 2025

### Summary
This week marked significant progress in establishing the core systems for RebelENGINE and advancing the rendering pipeline. The team focused on building the foundation for memory management, math library, and basic rendering capabilities. We've made good progress on the physics system with initial collision detection for primitives. Challenges were encountered with the animation system integration, but work is ongoing to establish a robust skeleton implementation. The asset pipeline has begun taking shape with initial model loading capabilities.
