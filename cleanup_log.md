# RebelSUITE Cleanup Log

## Date: 3/17/2025

### File Organization Process

1. **Created Directory Structure**
   - Created a `src` directory with 13 subdirectories to organize the codebase:
     - `geometry`: For geometric primitives and operations
     - `ui`: For user interface components
     - `tools`: For modeling and editing tools
     - `constraints`: For geometric constraints
     - `graphics`: For rendering and visualization
     - `core`: For core application functionality
     - `memory`: For memory management utilities
     - `joints`: For assembly joint types
     - `utils`: For utility classes and helpers
     - `layout`: For UI layout management
     - `selection`: For object selection functionality
     - `viewport`: For viewport and camera management
     - `scene`: For scene graph and node management

2. **File Categorization**
   - Analyzed all source files and categorized them based on functionality
   - Created arrays of files for each category in the organization script
   - Moved files to their respective directories using PowerShell

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created a detailed migration log (`migration_log.txt`)
   - Updated the README.md with the new project structure
   - Created this cleanup log to document the process

### File Statistics

- **Total Files Organized**: ~350 files
- **Files by Category**:
  - Geometry: ~70 files
  - UI: ~50 files
  - Tools: ~50 files
  - Constraints: ~20 files
  - Graphics: ~35 files
  - Core: ~40 files
  - Memory: ~20 files
  - Joints: ~12 files
  - Utils: ~15 files
  - Layout: ~20 files
  - Selection: ~20 files
  - Viewport: ~25 files
  - Scene: ~15 files

### Remaining Tasks

1. **CMake Updates**
   - The CMakeLists.txt file needs to be updated to reflect the new directory structure
   - Include paths in source files may need to be updated

2. **Test Organization**
   - Consider moving test files to a dedicated test directory structure
   - Currently, test files are kept alongside their implementation files

3. **Build Verification**
   - Verify that the project builds correctly with the new structure
   - Fix any include path issues that may arise

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Add more detailed documentation for each module
   - Consider generating API documentation with Doxygen

### Script Used

The file organization was performed using a PowerShell script (`organize_files.ps1`) that:
1. Defined arrays of files for each category
2. Created a function to move files to their respective directories
3. Executed the move operations for each category
4. Provided feedback on the process

The script has been preserved for reference and potential future reorganizations.
